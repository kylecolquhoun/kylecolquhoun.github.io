  <h2><span>End Go</span>al</h2>
  <p class="boldaf">
By the end of this chapter you should have a strong knowledge on different web technologies & practices and how to put them to use. To check your knowledge their will be a task for you to complete at the end using all your skills.
  </p>
  <h2><span>What Is HTM</span>L?</h2>
  <p class="">
   HTML(Hyper Text Mark-up Language) Is the programming language used to allow for the browser to determine what should be displayed on the page. HTML tells the DOM what content is trying to be displayed and provides details as to how it should be displayed and formatted based off of different attributes.</p>
  <h2><span>HTML - Ta</span>gs</h2>
  <p>Tags are what the DOM is looking for as it’s the tags that tell the DOM how it should be displaying the content. For example if we wanted to display the page heading “Hello World” we could use an h1 tag.</p>
  <p>
   " &lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;" - This is an HTML tag structure that mostly all tags will follow. As you can see there are two different tags that we use that look really similar, one is an opening tag and one is the closing tag.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Opening "&lt;h1&gt;" tag tells the DOM that any content after this tag will be formatted as a heading, then we tell the DOM we have reached the end of the content that should be a heading by adding in the closing "&lt;/h1&gt;" tag.
  </p>
  <p class="boldaf">Now before we go any further lets talk more about HTML tags.</p>
  <p>A tag can be made up of several different things, so far all we need to know is that these tags can have different attributes, each attribute allows the element to behave in a different way, for example we could add the title attribute to the &lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; tag.</p>
  <pre><code class="html">
<ol>
<li>&lt;h1 title="Hello World"&gt;My Title&lt;/h1&gt;</li>

</ol>
</code></pre>
  <p>as you can see just after h1 inside the opening tag I have added in the title attribute, the title attribute tells the DOM that when we move our mouse over the text displayed it will also display a small tooltip with the message entered between the quotation marks.</p>
  <h2><span>HTML - Page Structu</span>re</h2>
  <p class="boldaf">Now let's take a look at the basic HTML page structure!</p>
  <pre><code class="html">
<ol>
<li>&lt;html&gt;</li>
<li>    &lt;head&gt;</li>
<li>      &lt;title&gt;My First Site&lt;/title&gt;</li>
<li>    &lt;/head&gt;</li>
<li>  &lt;body&gt;</li>
<li>&lt;!-- Code Goes Here --&gt;</li>
<li></li>
<li>&lt;style&gt;</li>
<li>&lt;/style&gt;</li>
<li>  &lt;/body&gt;</li>
<li>&lt;/html&gt;</li>

</ol>
</code></pre>
  <p>As you can see above each of the opening tags eventually are closed by using the corresponding closing tag, you may have noticed a strange looking tag in their that we haven’t talked about yet.</p>
  
  <p>This is a comment tag, these are used by developers; for developers by adding in meaningful comment statements that allow us to describe what different sections of our code are doing, these become really useful when you are working on large scale projects with other developers so that no one is left confused by the code written as we each write code in our own special ways.</p>
  
  <p>
    Each tag seen above has a special purpose in how the website is displayed, the opening ‘html’ tag let’s the DOM know that we are going to be providing it HTML code, the ‘head’ tag is where we will be initialising different files later on in the project, the head section is one of the first that the DOM reads so it is always good practice to add links to any external resources needed for the project to run in this section.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The ‘Body’ tag as you might have guessed is where we are going to put in all of our main content, for the most part any code we add in to the HTML file will most likely always be between the body tags, after the body tag we reach the rest of the closing tags to let the DOM know that we are now finished providing it with HTML code.
  </p>
  <p class="boldaf">
    Challenge: Try creating a web page with a heading that tells the user a message.
  </p>
  <h2><span>What is CS</span>S?</h2>
  <p class="boldaf">CSS(Cascading StyleSheets) is a stylesheet language that is used to describe to the DOM how the presentation of an HTML document should be. </p>
  <p>
    An easy way to think of HTML and CSS together is like a face.
HTML is used to describe the different features present, once all the features are in place, CSS acts as the makeup to the face. CSS can be used to style the HTML document, for example CSS is responsible for changing different characteristics of HTML elements such as the style of the font, colour of the font, etc.

  </p>
  
  <p class="boldaf">
CSS Syntax - CSS rules are made up of two things; a selector and a declaration block. The <span class="red-text">selector</span> is simply the elements name, class, or ID, it's declaration needs a <span class="blue-text">property</span> which in turn requires a <span class="green-text">value</span>. The syntax looks a bit like this:<br /> <span class="red-text">h1</span>{<span class="blue-text">color</span>:<span class="green-text">red</span>; <span class="blue-text">font-size</span>:<span class="green-text">18px</span>;} 
  </p>
  <h2><span>CSS - Selectors</span></h2>

  <div class="boldaf">
    <p>Their are 5 main categories of selectors, but for now we will focus on using the Simple selectors.</p>
  </div>
  
  <p>CSS Selectors are used to find or target HTML elements that you would like to style. The most basic and most generic way of selecting an element is to just simply use the name of the element.</p>
  <h3>Example</h3>
  <pre><code class="css">
<ol>
<li>/*This is a single-line comment in CSS */</li>
<li>p {</li>
<li>  color:blue;</li>
<li>  text-align:center;</li>
<li>/* This is a multi-</li>
<li>line comment and is also in CSS */</li>
<li>}</li>


</ol>
</code></pre>
  <p>In the above example we are telling the DOM that all '&lt;p&gt;' elements should be the colour blue and all text within these tags should be center aligned.<br /><b> If you've already noticed their are some sketchy looking lines of code in the above example, these are known as comments. As a developer you will be familiar with comments so we wont spend much time on these as they are pretty self explanitory.</b></p>
  <p>Another way we can select an element is by giving the element a class name. To do this we add the class attribute to the <b>'&lt;p class="my-para"&gt;'</b> element in the HTML code. We then use a period(.) followed by the class name we gave the element to select it.</p>
  <h3>Example</h3>
  <p class="boldaf">the below code is a snippet and not a complete runnable file.</p>
  <pre><code class="html">
<ol>
<li>&lt;body&gt;</li>
<li>&lt;p class="my-para"&gt;This is a paragraph I want to style. &lt;/p&gt;</li>
<li>&lt;/body&gt;</li>
<li>&lt;style&gt;</li>
<li>/*Changed from tag name selection to class name selection */</li>
<li>.my-para {</li>
<li>  color:blue;</li>
<li>  text-align:center;</li>
<li>}</li>
<li>&lt;/style&gt;</li>
</ol>
</code></pre>
  <p><b>In the above code you can see that we no longer use the tag name as the selector and instead use the class name we gave it in the html code.</b></p>
  <p>Another way that we might like to use for selecting the element would be by giving it an ID. To do this we give the tag an ID aswell as or instead of a class. This looks like: <br />
    <b> &lt;p id="my-para"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</b>.
  </p>
  <p class="boldaf">
    It is always good practice to use ID's to uniquely identify an element and classes to group elements with similar properties together.
</p>
  <h3>Example</h3>
  <p><b>In this example we create 4 paragraphs that are all center aligned with red text apart from the first one that also needs to have italic text.</b></p>
  <pre><code class="html">
<ol>
<li>&lt;body&gt;</li>
<li>&lt;p id="para1" class="paras"&gt;This is a paragraph I want to style. &lt;/p&gt;</li>
<li>&lt;p id="para2" class="paras"&gt;This is a paragraph I want to style. &lt;/p&gt;</li>
<li>&lt;p id="para3" class="paras"&gt;This is a paragraph I want to style. &lt;/p&gt;</li>
<li>&lt;p id="para4" class="paras"&gt;This is a paragraph I want to style. &lt;/p&gt;</li>
<li>&lt;/body&gt;</li>
<li>&lt;style&gt;</li>
<li>/*Changed from tag name selection to ID name selection */</li>
<li>.paras {</li>
<li>  color:red;</li>
<li>  text-align:center;</li>
<li>}</li>
<li>#para1{</li>
<li>font-style:italic;</li>
<li>}</li>
<li>&lt;/style&gt;</li>
</ol>
</code></pre>
  <p>
    As you can see in the above code, by giving each paragraph the same class name I was able to assign the CSS rules against each of them using less lines of code by specifying the CSS code for each "P" element.
  </p>
  <p class="boldaf">
    When it comes to using the ID attribute, the value provided must NEVER start with a number. Although the HTML syntax would be correct, the CSS standard have clearly stated that an id selector cannot start with an integer.
