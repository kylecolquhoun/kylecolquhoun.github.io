I have been a software developer for the past 4 years and still very much beginning in the world of code. I have had a keen interest in software development since a young age and took a great liking to web development as this felt like something, I could strive in. As a very imaginative person I realised that I could create websites to branch out these ideas that flood my head daily so I took my first steps to diving into tech and through this blog I will take you with me on my journey through the amazing world of technology.">

      I have been a software developer for the past 4 years and still very much beginning in the world of code. I have had a keen interest in software development since a young age and took a great liking to web development as this felt like something, I could strive in.

      <p>
      Before I developed a keen interest in computing music was and still is very much my passion, its something that I still enjoy to this day and continue to dedicate all my life to food, sleep, programming and music as theirs nothing else in life that brings me joy as much as they do, especially since through them both they have taught me that great things come with commitment, determination and hard work. It all pays off.
