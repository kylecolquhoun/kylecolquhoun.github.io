This Chapter is just a brief introduction to the technologies that will be used in the creation of this app, this tutorial will not provide an in depth tutorial of each technology used please refer to prior tutorials provided for a better understanding.
  </p>
  <h2><span>What Is Pytho</span>n?</h2>
  <p>
    Python, first released in 1991, is one of the most popular languages at the time and is used by numerous developers worldwide. Python is considered to be a high-level language that prides it’s self on its easy to read code due to the indentation procedures that you follow when writing blocks of code.
  </p>
  <h2><span>What Is Flas</span>k?</h2>
  <p>
    Flask is considered a micro web framework due to it not requiring on a particular set of tools or libraries. Due to this it has a strong community that provide different tools and libraries for you to make use of in your development, this could be for anything from setting up a database; to performing input validation.</p><p>
  <b>Flask</b> was written / developed in Python without a Database abstraction layer making it lightweight and easy to use compared to one of it’s close buddies <b>Django</b>.</p><p>
  <b>Django</b> is still a good choice but is a large-scale framework that is great for database-driven websites.
  </p><p class="boldaf">
  For the time being we will be using Flask.

  </p>
  
    <h2><span>First - The basic</span>s!</h2>
  <p>
    I’m sure by now you at least know what a website is and what their most common uses are. We use them constantly and these days even shops have decided that they are best to jump on the trend and join the ever-growing web community to maximise their client reach.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>As a developer.</b> Websites can mean a lot more than just another place to order and buy a nice new shiny watch, it’s a vision, a sense of achievement, it’s one way you can get your idea out their to the world. And the best part? It’s not as hard as you’d think.
  </p>
  <p class="boldaf">
    Websites consist of 3 main web technologies. These are <b>HTML5</b>, <b>CSS3</b> and <b>JS</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b> HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language)</b> is the most commonly used web technology. It is used to describe to the <b>DOM(document Object Model)</b> what type of content is to be displayed on the website and tells it how to display it, <b>HTML</b> tells the <b>DOM</b> this by defining what is called <b>“tags”</b>. 
  </p>
  <p class="boldaf">
    Below you can see a basic HTML page structure!
  </p>

 <pre><code class="html">
<ol>
<li>&lt;html&gt;</li>
<li>    &lt;head&gt;</li>
<li>      &lt;title&gt;My First Site&lt;/title&gt;</li>
<li>    &lt;/head&gt;</li>
<li>  &lt;body&gt;</li>
<li>&lt;!-- Code Goes Here --&gt;</li>
<li></li>
<li>&lt;style&gt;</li>
<li>&lt;/style&gt;</li>
<li>  &lt;/body&gt;</li>
<li>&lt;/html&gt;</li>

</ol>
</code></pre>
  <p class="boldaf">
    lets work our way down the tags!
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><p><b>&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</b> - These tags are used to specify that all data within these tags should be read, compiled and displayed by the DOM.</p></li>
    
    <li><p><b>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</b> - These Tags are one of the first interpreted by the DOM and is good practice to add in any files that may need loaded in here, such as CSS files, or script files to allow them to load at the start of the code instead of the end as this could cause issues in the future.</p></li>
    
    <li><p><b>&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</b> - These tags are used to specify what the name of your website is going to be, the title tags are always located in between the <b>‘&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;’</b> tags in the document as this gives your site an identity.</p></li>
    
    <li><p><b>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</b> - These tags are used to specify where the main content of the website is, in between these tags you will have different tags representing different content such as text and multimedia items that you want to display to the user.</p></li>
    <p class="boldaf">
      Checkout <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/">w3schools</a> for a list of more tags and how to use them.
    </p>
    
  </ul>
    <h2><span>What Is CS</span>S?</h2>
  <p>
    <b>CSS(Cascading Style Sheets)</b> is used to describe to the DOM how you want different elements on the web site to look. Previously you seen me make use of the heading1 tag “&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;” to tell the DOM to write “My Heading” onto the webpage.
  </p>
  <p>
    But what if we wanted to have the text colour as red instead of black for example.
  </p>
  <p><b>Here are a few ways we can do this in the HTML file.</b></p>
  <pre><code class="html">
<ol>
<li>&lt;html&gt;</li>
<li>    &lt;head&gt;</li>
<li>      &lt;title&gt;My First Site&lt;/title&gt;</li>
<li>    &lt;/head&gt;</li>
<li>  &lt;body&gt;</li>
<li>&lt;!-- Changing the color using inline CSS --&gt;</li>
<li>&lt;h1 style="color:red;"&gt;My Heading&lt;/h1&gt;</li>
<li>  &lt;/body&gt;</li>
<li>&lt;style&gt;</li>
<li>/*This is another way you can use CSS by using the style tags */</li>
<li>/*These tags are just their to tell the DOM to start expecting CSS*/</li>
<li>h1{</li>
<li>  color:red;</li>
<li>}</li>
<li>&lt;/style&gt;</li>
<li>&lt;/html&gt;</li>

</ol>
</code></pre>
  <p class="boldaf">
    As you can see above this is a basic example of CSS but we aren't going to spend to much time learning these things as their not as important just yet.
  </p>
  <h2><span>What Is JavaScrip</span>t?</h2>
  <p>
    JavaScript is an object-oriented scripting language and like python is also considered a high-level language. JavaScript is the backbone of a website, it allows you to dynamically update the content on the DOM by using triggering certain events. 
  </p>
  <p class="boldaf">
    JavaScript is a useful tool for bringing a website to life as it adds functionality to a website and can be used for a variety of different things, from form validation to animating a day-night circle animation on your webpage.
  </p>
  <p>
  For this reason javascript is a great language to use and in this tutorial we will eventually learn how we can pass data between JavaScript and Python by using a text format known as <b>JSON(JavaScript Object Notation)</b> to send data to and from each of the languages.
  </p>
  <p>
    To use Javascript in an HTML document we can use "&lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;" tags to allow us to write JS code in the HTML document, in the future we will be referencing our JS file from another folder in the project file structure but for now we will use the script tags. 
  </p>
   <pre><code class="html">
<ol>
<li>&lt;html&gt;</li>
<li>    &lt;head&gt;</li>
<li>      &lt;title&gt;My First Site&lt;/title&gt;</li>
<li>    &lt;/head&gt;</li>
<li>  &lt;body&gt;</li>
<li>&lt;!-- Changing the color using inline CSS --&gt;</li>
<li>&lt;button onclick="myFunction()"&gt;Click Me!&lt;/button&gt;</li>
<li>  &lt;/body&gt;</li>
<li>&lt;script type="text/javscript"&gt;</li>
<li>function myFunction(){</li>
<li>alert("Hello World!");</li>
<li>}</li>
<li>&lt;/script&gt;</li>
<li>&lt;/html&gt;</li>

</ol>
</code></pre>
  <p class="boldaf">
    <b>NOTE:</b> all CSS and JS files will eventually be moved into their own separate folders for a nicer, cleaner looking file structure.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is just an introduction to the technologies that are going to be used. To start the project head to the next tutorial.
